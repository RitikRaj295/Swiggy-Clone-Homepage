# Swiggy Clone Homepage

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Swiggy homepage built using **React**. The goal of this project was to recreate the dynamic and interactive features of the Swiggy homepage, including a functional UI and smooth animations on card items. 

The project leverages **React** for efficient UI rendering and **Fetch API** for interacting with a local API to fetch data and display it dynamically.

## Features

- **Dynamic Card Items**: The homepage features animated cards that display restaurant and food details.
- **Fetch API**: The project uses the Fetch API to interact with a local API file, enabling the display of dynamic content.
- **Responsive Design**: The homepage is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Card items on the homepage are animated using CSS for smooth transitions and hover effects.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Fetch API**: Used to request data from a local API and update the UI.
- **CSS Animations**: For adding smooth animations and hover effects on card items.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.

## How It Works
<ul>
<li>React Components: The project is divided into reusable React components that manage various parts of the homepage, such as the header, card items, and footer.</li>
<li>Fetching Data: A local API file is used to simulate fetching data. The Fetch API makes asynchronous requests to retrieve the necessary data for displaying items on the homepage.</li>
<li>Animations: CSS animations are used for smooth transitions and hover effects to enhance the user experience, especially on the interactive card elements.</li>
  </ul>
